# Improving Building Energy Efficiency by IoT and Mobile Computing (Tentative)

# Abstract

Building environment management is always on the front line of the energy economic issue since its heating, cooling, lighting, 
ventilation, air conditioning system takes great part on energy consumption. According to the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration (EIA) estimates, residential and commercial buildings consumed about 40% of total U.S. energy consumption, 
which equals 39 quadrillion British thermal units(BTU). [1] Environment science researches has repeatedly proved that 
high-efficiency building infrastructure developed by appropriate artificial intelligence techniques provides great opportunities
on decreasing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission [2]. Internet of Things, as a suite of technologies and applications
which equip devices (sensors) and locations generating necessary information, is advancing building energy management with 
balance between occupants’ satisfaction and energy saving. [3] We implemented an IOT system with non-intrusive multi-modal sensors
to collecting real-time building environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, ambient light, CO2, acoustic frequency, and 
occupancy status. Our experiment testbed is located on our campus and the types of space various from small close enclosure space 
(office, small lab, small classroom) to large open space (library, lobby hall). Based on the data we collected from IOT network, 
we can accurately estimate occupancy size and situation and predict future occupancy by building agent model of the occupants. 
The result of predictions will be important reference in the application to control HVAC system and artificial lighting adjustments
and eventually increase building efficient and environment performance by adapting to the forecast of occupancy changes in each 
specific location.
